**Project Title**

“Scraping Data for 52-Week Low Stocks from www.tradingview.com”


**Project Overview**

This code scrapes information for stocks that hit their 52-week low price from www.tradingview.com, and then subsets those that have low price-to-earnings (PE) ratio. This is a tool for searching undervalued stocks for investment. It can help to narrow down the list of stocks that are potentially undervalued. 


**Data Understanding and Limitations**

The code can be used to scrape data from www.tradingview.com on daily basis. Based on the scraped information, it generates a list of stocks that might be undervalued. It shortlists stocks that might be good for investment. However, the shortlisted stocks need to be further analyzed before making an investment decision.
Therefore, this code should NOT be used for stock selection without further detailed analysis.
 
tradingview.com often changes the columns of its 52-week low table column names. This may require adjustments in the code.
